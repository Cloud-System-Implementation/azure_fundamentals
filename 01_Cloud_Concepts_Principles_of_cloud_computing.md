**Some Important terminology:**
1. **Vertical scaling**, also known as **"scaling up"**, is the process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server. Some examples of vertical scaling are: adding more CPUs, or adding more memory.

2. **Horizontal scaling**, also known as **"scaling out"**, is the process of adding more servers that function together as one unit. For example, you have more than one server processing incoming requests.

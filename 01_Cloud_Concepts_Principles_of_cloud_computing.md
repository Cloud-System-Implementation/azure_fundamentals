1. Cloud Concepts - Principles of cloud computing

> "Cloud computing in very simple terms, is basically where a company uses someone elses computing services that include compute power, storage, networking and analytics (usually over the internet) instead of having to run that software on their own computers."

> "Benefits of cloud computing : It's cost-effective, scalable, elastic, current, reliable, global && secure"

# Introduction

## cloud computing services

- compute power: VMS, containers and serverless
- storage: database...
- networking.
- analytics.

## Benefits of cloud computing

- cost-effective: pay-as-you-go, consumption-base pricing model
- scalable: vertical(scaling up) and horizantal(scaling out).
- elastic: automatically adding or removing resources.
- currrent: focus on what matters(building and deploying applications).
- reliable: data backup, disaster recovery, and data replication services.
- global: datacenters located in various regions all over the globe.
- secure: provide better security than most organizations can achieve(physical/digital security).

## Compliance terms and requirements

In data storage terminology, the word compliance is used to refer to industry-wide government regulations and rules that cite how data is managed and the need for organizations to be in compliance with those regulations. [more](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/compliance.html)

**Some Important terminology:**
1. **Vertical scaling**, also known as **"scaling up"**, is the process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server. Some examples of vertical scaling are: adding more CPUs, or adding more memory.

2. **Horizontal scaling**, also known as **"scaling out"**, is the process of adding more servers that function together as one unit. For example, you have more than one server processing incoming requests.

1. Cloud Concepts - Principles of cloud computing

> "Cloud computing in very simple terms, is basically where a company uses someone elses computing services that include compute power, storage, networking and analytics (usually over the internet) instead of having to run that software on their own computers."

> "Benefits of cloud computing : It's cost-effective, scalable, elastic, current, reliable, global && secure"

# Introduction

## cloud computing services

- compute power: VMS, containers and serverless
- storage: database...
- networking.
- analytics.

## Benefits of cloud computing

- cost-effective: pay-as-you-go, consumption-base pricing model
- scalable: vertical(scaling up) and horizantal(scaling out).
- elastic: automatically adding or removing resources.
- currrent: focus on what matters(building and deploying applications).
- reliable: data backup, disaster recovery, and data replication services.
- global: datacenters located in various regions all over the globe.
- secure: provide better security than most organizations can achieve(physical/digital security).

## Compliance terms and requirements

In data storage terminology, the word compliance is used to refer to industry-wide government regulations and rules that cite how data is managed and the need for organizations to be in compliance with those regulations. [more](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/compliance.html)

- Azure is the only major cloud provider that contractually commits to conformance with the [CJIS](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis) Security Policy.
- Azure have obtained STAR Certification. This STAR certification is based on achieving [ISO/IEC 27001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27001) certification and meeting criteria specified in the [Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/cloud-controls-matrix)
- Azure delivers to its enterprise cloud customers meet current EU standards for international transfers of data [(GDPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation).
- Azure offers customers a [HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act) [Business Associate Agreement (BAA)](https://www.totalhipaa.com/business-associate-agreement-101/) as a contract addendum
- Microsoft is the first cloud provider to have adopted the [ISO/IEC 27018](https://www.iso.org/standard/76559.html) code of practice, covering the processing of personal information by cloud service providers.
- Microsoft cloud services received [MTCS 584](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS584) certification across all three service classifications (Iaas, Paas, Saas)
-  Microsoft-covered cloud services are audited at least annually against the [SOC](https://www.schellman.com/blog/2016/01/what-are-service-organization-controls-soc-reports/) report framework by independent third-party auditors.
- Microsoft cloud services are certified according to the [FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov/cloud-service-providers/) standards.
- Azure has received official accreditation from the UK Government Pan Government Accreditor [(UK Government G-Cloud)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government_G-Cloud).

## Economies of scale

Economies of scale is the ability to do things more efficiently or at a lower-cost per unit when operating at a larger scale. This cost advantage is an important benefit in cloud computing. Providers can then pass the savings on to their customers.

----------

**Some Important terminology:**
1. **Vertical scaling**, also known as **"scaling up"**, is the process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server. Some examples of vertical scaling are: adding more CPUs, or adding more memory.

2. **Horizontal scaling**, also known as **"scaling out"**, is the process of adding more servers that function together as one unit. For example, you have more than one server processing incoming requests.


## Types of cloud services

Based on a deployment model, we can classify cloud as:

- public,
- private,
- hybrid
- community cloud

Based on a service the cloud model is offering, we are speaking of either:

- IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)
- PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)
- SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)or, Storage, Database, Information, Process, Application, Integration, Security, Management, Testing-as-a-service
